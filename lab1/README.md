# [ECE595 Programming Project 1](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ece595/labs_2018/lab1.html)
## Description
> This first project first sets up the DLXOS directory structure and dev environment on an ECN Linux machine. Then, a new user trap called "Getpid" is implemented. This trap returns an integer representing the ID of the current process. When DLXOS is run on the hardware simulator, the integer PID is printed.
