TASK 1: Implement a user program named "fdisk" to format your disk.
  
  REQUIREMENTS:
    - inode structure should be 128 bytes
    - 128 inodes in FS
    - 10 direct-addressed entries in the inode's virt block transl table
    - 1 indirect-addressed block that is only allocated as needed
    - 1 double-indirect-addressed block that is only allocated as needed
  
  NOTES:
    - use user traps for the disk simulator to...
        1. write blocks
        2. read disk size
        3. read disk blocksize
    - use disk_write_block(int phyblock, char * data) in FdiskWriteBlock
      to write to the disk, not dfs
